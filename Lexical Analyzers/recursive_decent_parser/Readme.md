This is a Lexical analyzer and a Parser implemented in Python for the purpose of learning and practice. I have implemented Recursive Decent Parser for C++ language. 

Given File contain two classes:
Lexer and Parser

In lexer tokens are being generated from the input variable named as: blank_var. An input file can also be given as a input source.

Parser class is using list of Tokens and checking the syntax accordingly. There is also a symbol table implemented which can be in the semantic phase of the compiler.
